# Python PDF Tools

**Python PDF Tools** is a Python-based collection of ready-to-use applications designed for various PDF manipulations. Each tool is set up as an independent app that can be triggered by running a batch file located in the root of its folder. This project is under active development, and it currently includes functions such as merging, splitting, compressing, converting, and protecting PDFs, among other essential features.

## Current Status

The project is currently in development, and functionalities are being implemented gradually. Each function is organized into its own folder within the repository, with individual `input`, `output`, and `scripts` folders to allow easy, modular usage of each tool.
